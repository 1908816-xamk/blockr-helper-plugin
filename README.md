# blockr-helper-plugin
This tiny helper plugin is meant to use with my "Blockr" Vue application by to extend native REST API functionalities on the WordPress side.
Also an old but still great plugin called Attachment Taxonomies (https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-taxonomies/) by Felix Arntz is required to ensure, that this plugin and "Blockr" Vue app works properly.
