# blockr-helper-plugin
This tiny helper plugin is meant to use with my **[Blockr Vue App](https://github.com/henritik/blockr-vue-app)** to extend native Rest API and some other functionalities on the WordPress side.

Also an another small plugin called **[Attachment Taxonomies](https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-taxonomies/)** by Felix Arntz is required to ensure that **Blockr Vue App** works properly. Alternatively, a bit more  versatile plugin called **[Media Library Assistant](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-library-assistant/)** by David Lingren can be also used to create attachment taxonomies. This plugin can be very useful especially when there is need to handle bigger amount of photos at once.
